A movie recommendation system suggests movies to users based on their past preferences and similarities with other users. 
This repository implements an item-based collaborative filtering approach to recommend movies to users. 
It also determines the films watched by the user to make personalized suggestions.

Movie recommendation systems play a crucial role in the digital entertainment industry by providing personalized movie suggestions 
to users. These systems are essential for several reasons:

  1. Enhancing User Experience: Movie recommendation systems enhance the user experience by helping users discover movies that align
      with their tastes and preferences. With the vast amount of movies available today, users often struggle to find movies that they
      would enjoy. Recommendation systems alleviate this problem by presenting tailored suggestions.

  2. Increasing User Engagement: By offering relevant movie recommendations, recommendation systems keep users engaged and encourage them
      to spend more time exploring and watching movies. This increased engagement leads to higher user satisfaction and retention,
      benefiting both users and movie streaming platforms.

The dataset used for training and evaluating the recommendation system is the MovieLens 20M dataset from Kaggle. It consists of ratings
provided by users for various movies. The dataset provides information about movies, user ratings, and user-movie interactions.

Item-based collaborative filtering is a popular approach used in movie recommendation systems. It leverages the similarity between movies
based on user ratings to make recommendations. It works by identifying movies that are similar to the ones a user has already watched and
enjoyed. By analyzing the user's past preferences and the ratings of other users, item-based collaborative filtering identifies movies with
similar characteristics and recommends them to the user.

Determining the films watched by the user to make suggestions is another crucial component of a recommendation system. By understanding the
user's movie watching history, the system can create a personalized profile for the user and make tailored recommendations based on their
unique preferences. This approach allows the system to consider the user's specific tastes, genres, actors, directors, and other factors 
when generating recommendations.

By combining item-based collaborative filtering with determining the films watched by the user, the movie recommendation system can provide
accurate and personalized suggestions. This combination takes into account both the similarities between movies and the individual 
preferences of the user, resulting in highly relevant and appealing movie recommendations. It enhances the user experience, increases 
user engagement, and ultimately contributes to the success of movie streaming platforms.
